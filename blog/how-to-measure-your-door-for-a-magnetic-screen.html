<h1>How to Measure Your Door for a Magnetic Screen</h1>

<p>Before buying a magnetic screen door, make sure it’ll actually fit your doorway. Here's a quick guide that skips the fluff and gets you the numbers you need.</p>

<h2>1. Measure the Door Opening</h2>
<p>Use a tape measure to get the width and height of the actual door opening—not the trim or frame.</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Width:</strong> Measure across the top of the inside opening.</li>
  <li><strong>Height:</strong> Measure from the top edge to the floor or threshold.</li>
</ul>

<h2>2. Compare to Standard Sizes</h2>
<p>Most magnetic screens are made for common sizes like:</p>
<ul>
  <li>36" x 80" (standard door)</li>
  <li>38" x 82" (taller doors)</li>
  <li>Up to 72" wide (for French or double doors)</li>
</ul>

<p>If your measurements are close, pick a screen with a little extra overlap. Velcro edges will help you seal it snugly.</p>

<h2>3. Don’t Forget Clearance</h2>
<p>Check if you have enough flat surface around the door frame to stick the Velcro. Some tight frames or textured surfaces may need extra prep.</p>

<h2>Best Option?</h2>
